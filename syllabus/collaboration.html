        <h1>Collaboration</h1>
        <p>Collaboration - the ability to work together to accomplish a task, goal or outcome - is a skill that is consistently mentioned by employers as a requirement for new and seasoned employees. In this course you will be requried to work with others on a weekly basis using both the discussion board and team meetings. Each individual is responsible for her or his own work, but interacting, supporting, assisting and collaborating are desirable and required in this class.</p>
        <h2>Learning Teams</h2>
        <p>During week 2 you will organize yourselves into learning teams of 3 or 4. This is true for both on-campus and on-line sections.</p>
									<h3>On-Campus Sections</h3>
									<p>Teams will sit together and collaborate during class. Your attendance and active participation in class will be graded.</p>
									<h3>On-line Sections</h3>
									<p>In an online environment it is strongly suggested that you work with others in or near your own timezone whenever possible. The team will become your primary source for feedback and help. You are required to meet together each week to discuss the content of the week, assessments, insights and help one another with these things. These team meetings will be arranged for a location (Google Hangouts are suggested as <i>Skype</i> will interfere with your local web server) and time that is acceptable to those in the team. Your attendance at and participation in the weekly meeting will be graded.</p>
        <h2>Discussion Board</h2>
        <p>Each week has a discussion board for the entire class. You are expected to participate in the discussion board weekly. Specifically, it is expected that you will post questions that you may have, answer a question from someone else or share an outside resource that contributes to the weekly topic(s). The key word here is <i>"meaningful"</i>. It is expected that your participation is truly assisting the class and its members to move forward! Your participation will be graded.</p>
