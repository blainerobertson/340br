      <h1>Collaboration</h1>
      <p>Collaboration - the ability to work together to accomplish a task, goal or outcome - is a skill that is
        consistently mentioned by employers as a requirement for new and seasoned employees. In this course you will be
        requried to work with others on a weekly basis using both the discussion board and team meetings. Each
        individual is responsible for her or his own work, but interacting, supporting, assisting and collaborating are
        desirable and required in this class.</p>
      <h2>Learning Teams</h2>
      <p>During week 2 you will organize yourselves into learning teams of 3 or 4. This is true for both on-campus and
        on-line sections.</p>

      <h3>On-line Sections</h3>
      <p>In an online environment it is strongly suggested that you work with others in or near your own timezone
        whenever possible. The team will become your primary source for feedback and help. You are required to meet
        together each week to discuss the content of the week, assessments, insights and help one another with these
        things. These team meetings will be arranged for by the team. Google Meeting, Zoom, and/or Microsoft Teams are
        suggested tools. You should not use <i>Skype</i> as it will interfere with your local web server. Your
        attendance at and participation in the weekly meeting will be graded.</p>
      <h3>On-Campus Sections</h3>
      <p>Teams will sit together and collaborate during class. Your attendance and active participation in
        class will be graded.</p>
      <h2>Discussion Board</h2>
      <p>Each week has a discussion board for the entire class. You are expected to participate in the discussion board
        weekly. Specifically, it is expected that you will post questions that you may have, answer a question from
        someone else or share an outside resource that contributes to the weekly topic(s). The key word here is
        <i>"meaningful"</i>. It is expected that your participation is truly assisting the class and its members to move
        forward! Your participation will be graded.</p>
      <p>Be a builder and a contributor via the boards!</p>
