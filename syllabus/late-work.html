        <h1>Late Work Policy</h1>
        <p>Work is due as specified by the course calendar and indicated in the weekly overview pages and assessment descriptions. Typically assessments are due Saturday evenings at 11pm Mountain Time (America/Boise time zone).</p>
        <h2>What is late?</h2>
        <p>Work is considered late when not submitted:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>on time, or</li>
          <li>in an incomplete form, or</li>
          <li>submitting the wrong assessment.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>Be sure to check links to videos for operability and that the correct assessment was submitted to the correct location. It is your responsibility to make sure things are correct.</p>
        <h2>Penalty</h2>
        <p>Work that is late may be submitted through the Saturday prior to the final project being due for 50% credit.</p>
        <h2>Notification</h2>
        <p>When submitting late work you must also email the professor indicating that a late submission has been made. Be sure to specify the name of the late assessment and where it was submitted.</p>
