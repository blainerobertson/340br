        <h1>Submitting Work</h1>
        <dl style="line-height: 1.5">
          <dt><b>Q: How will I submit my work?</b></dt>
          <dd><b>A:</b> All work for this class is done and submitted to the designated weekly assignment folder as a
            zip file of the folder containing the work. In addition, you will create a screencast of the finished work
            and post the URL to the assignment dropbox comment.</dd>

          <dt><b>Q: Why do I include a video URL when I submit my work?</b></dt>
          <dd><b>A:</b> It serves as an additional validation that your work is operating. The video <b>MUST</b> be
            narrated by you as you perform the tasks. In cannot be silent or be only music.</dd>

          <dt><b>Q: How will the professor or teaching assistant find my work to assess it?</b></dt>

          <dd><b>A:&nbsp;</b>They will look in the assignment dropbox for the week to find your submission.</dd>

          <dt><b>Q: How will the grader see my database?</b></dt>

          <dd><b>A:</b> In most cases, the professor or teaching assistant will not need to see the database. But, when
            necessary you will asked to show it in your assessment video. The final project will require you to submit a
            SQL file of the entire database.</dd>

          <dt><b>Q: In the grade book, I see the name of assessments listed more than once. Each one has a different
              number accompanying it. Why the duplicates?</b></dt>

          <dd><b>A:</b> Each number refers to a course objective. This class is graded based on demonstrated mastery of
            course objectives. In order for the I-Learn grade book to accept a score for each objective that a
            particular assessment may include, it requires a separate grade book entry.</dd>

          <dt><b>Q: What if I have questions about completing or submitting an assessment?</b></dt>

          <dd><b>A:</b> Use the Discussion Boards (early) to ask your question because chances are that if you have a
            question, others will also have that same question. Then, when someone finds the answer and posts it,
            everybody now the answer. The professor will monitor the Discussion Board for each week, and if another
            student doesn&rsquo;t answer your question, the professor will, or you can always ask the professor or
            teaching assistant directly.</dd>

          <dt><b>Q: Why am I required to work with others on my assessments?</b></dt>

          <dd><b>A:</b> The number one skill we hear from employers that hire our students is that they want people who
            can work with others. You are still expected to do your own work, but you have to be able to collaborate and
            communicate. By requiring you to work together to solve the problems and build the necessary tools to
            complete the task, you learn how to successfully cooperate and communicate with other people.</dd>
