				<h1>Classification View</h1>
				<p>In the previous activities we made sure the main navigation link sent the correct data to the
					"vehicles controller" and
					that two custom functions were created to 1) query the vehicles from the database based on the
					classification they belong to and then 2) build an unordered list around the vehicle data. That
					leaves the actual view needed to display the vehicles.</p>

				<h2>Video Overview</h2>
				<p>This video overviews the functionality at the end of this activity.</p>
				<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2SaR6tC8Hc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<h2>Build the View</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Using your view template, create a new "classification.php" view and save it in the <b>view</b>
						folder.</li>
					<li>This is our "Classification" view for showing a list of vehicles by classification, thus the
						name.</li>
					<li>In the view we want to make it obvious which classification is being displayed.</li>
					<li>Scroll down to the &lt;title&gt; element and add the following PHP code block to the beginning
						of it, prior to any other existing text. When done, it should look similar to this:
						<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php echo $classificationName; ?&gt; vehicles | PHP Motors, Inc.&lt;/title&gt;</code></pre>
					</li>
					<li>Scroll down to the main content heading (this should be inside the &lt;main&gt; element) and do
						the same thing. When
						done it should look similar to this:
						<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php echo $classificationName; ?&gt; vehicles&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
					</li>
					<li>Beneath the main content heading add the PHP code block to check for a message and display it if
						found:
						<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php if(isset($message)){
 echo $message; }
 ?&gt;</code></pre>
					</li>
					<li>Beneath the message check code block add another to display the vehicle list if it exists:
						<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php if(isset($vehicleDisplay)){
 echo $vehicleDisplay;
} ?&gt;</code></pre>
					</li>
					<li>That's it! Yep, you read that right, four lines of code and the view should be ready to go.</li>
					<li>However, it probably isn't going to look very pretty. That's why we will need to do some CSS
						work too.</li>
					<li>Be sure the view and all other files are saved.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Let's Test</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Start the Apache and Database servers if they are not already running.</li>
					<li>Run the "main controller". The home view should be delivered.</li>
					<li>Click one of the main navigation links.</li>
					<li>If things worked, you should be viewing the new view with the list of vehicles being displayed
						in the content area. The title and main content heading should clearly reflect which link you
						clicked. Click other links and watch how the view updates. Cool, huh?!!</li>
					<li>If things did not work, double check your code, get help, do whatever it takes to get things
						working.</li>
					<li>If things worked, "GREAT".</li>
					<li>Now we'll try to deal with images and appearance.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Images</h2>
				<p>Currently there are only two vehicle images and they are inside the "images" folder at the
					"phpmotors" root (at least they are if you downloaded the starter code early on).</p>
				<p>To get a more complete experience, <a href="../downloads/vehicles.zip" title="Download the file"
						target="_blank">download this new vehicle images folder</a> and place it inside the images
					folder. When you do so you will have to fix the link on
					the home view and the logo in all views.</p>

				<h2>Inventory Table</h2>
				<p>The <b>inventory</b> table has two fields dealing with images: invImage and invThumbnail. Both will
					have to be updated for each product so that the path to the image is accurate. You can make the
					alterations in one of two ways: 1) use your
					vehicle update process, or 2) use PHPMyAdmin. But the changes need to be made so the vehicle images
					display. The basic path should resemble this <code
						class="language-markup">/phpmotors/images/vehicles/[imagename.xxx]</code>.</p>

				<p>If you have other vehicles in your database, assign the "no-image.png" to them or find images and add
					those
					images and the appropriate path for the images.</p>

				<h2>The CSS File</h2>
				<p>When the vehicles are displayed we want a neat, professional presentation on small and large screens.
					To accomplish that
					we need to make some changes to the CSS file that dictates the appearance of the views. The provided
					code below is general
					in nature and you may need to revise and/or adapt it to fit your existing code.</p>

				<h3>Mobile First</h3>
				<p>My stylesheet is organized so that my media queries alter the style and layout as the screen size
					increases. The CSS rules <b>outside</b> of the media queries are for general appearance across all
					devices or are specific to small, mobile screen sizes. With that in mind, you may or may not have
					done the same and, as a result, may need to adapt this code. The code
					provided uses <a href="//css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" title="Open in a new tab"
						target="_blank">CSS Flexbox</a> for responsiveness.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>At or near the top of my stylesheet I have changed the CSS box model to use the border-box,
						instead of the content box:
						<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-css">html{
 box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, *:before, *:after{
 box-sizing: inherit;
}</code></pre>
						If this is unfamiliar, read <a href="//www.w3schools.com/csSref/css3_pr_box-sizing.asp"
							title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">CSS3 Box-Sizing Property</a>.
					</li>
					<li>Then, near the bottom of my mobile styles (before the media queries which should come after all
						of the mobile and general
						styles) I added three rules specific to displaying the list of vehicles in our new vehicle
						classification view:
						<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-css">#inv-display{
 margin: 0;
 padding: 0;
 display: flex;
 flex-direction: column;
}

#inv-display li{
 margin-bottom: .5em;
 border: 1px #ccc solid;
 list-style-type: none;
 flex: 1 1 auto;
}

#inv-display li img {
    max-width: 100%;
}</code></pre>
						<h4>An Explanation</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The first rule removes all of the padding and margin from the unordered list, turns it
								into a flex container and tells
								it to orient all content vertically (as a column).</li>
							<li>The second rule sets a small bottom margin on each list item, establishes a light gray
								border, removes the bullet from the item and tells each list item to grow or shrink as
								needed.</li>
							<li>The third rule makes the images responsive, meaning they will grow or shrink to fill the
								container they are in (the
								list item) or until they are full size.</li>
							<li>Since these rules are for mobile devices it is intended that each item will stack one
								atop the next so they are easily seen on a mobile device.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Media Queries - Larger Screens</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Next, I scrolled down into my media query for large screens (I only have one media query for screens larger than 768px
						wide). Near the bottom of my media query I added these new rules:
						<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-css">/* For vehicle display in classification view */
	#inv-display {
		flex-flow: row wrap;
		justify-content: flex-start;
	}

	#inv-display h2{
		font-size: 1rem;
	}

	#inv-display li {
		max-width: 200px;
		flex: 1 0 auto;
		text-align: center;
		height: 250px;
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: column;
		justify-content: space-between;
	}
      
	#inv-display div {
		width: 100%;
	}</code></pre>
						<h4>An Explanation</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The first rule changes the "flow" of the content from vertical (column) to horizontal
								(row) and allows it to wrap
								if there is not enough space on a line.</li>
							<li>The second rule changes the font size of the h2 element within the list item.</li>
							<li>The third rule formats the list item to grow but not shrink, allow content to flow
								vertically and separate the item with space between.</li>
							<li>The last rule simply makes sure the div inside the list item is full width.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Adapt as Needed</h3>
				<p>Every person's CSS file for the PHP Motors site is unique. The code I shared may need to be adapted
					to work in your site. Feel free to adapt as needed, but in the end, the vehicles being displayed
					should have a neat, professional appearance.</p>
