    <h1>Enhancement 1</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This enhancement is a review of the concepts, skills and techniques that should have been learned in WDD 230 - Web Frontend Development. It requires you to build a template and home page from that template for a ficticous web
     site - PHP Motors.
    </p>
    <h2>When done, you will have created:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Two php web pages: a template and a home page</li>
      <li>The pages will be responsive</li>
      <li>The pages will be valid HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>The pages will use PHP modularization for the header, navigation and footer</li>
      <li>The home page will include the content shown in the sample images</li>
      <li>Both pages will look similar to the images provided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notice!</h2>
    <p>All html and css must be of your own creation. No outside templates or frameworks are acceptable for this
     enhancement or future enhancements in the course.</p>

    <h3>Video Overview</h3>
    <p>This video provides a brief demonstration of what your finished enhancement should look like and how it should
     behave once done.</p>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <p>This enhancement assumes that you can code semantic and valid HTML5, CSS3 (including the use of media queries and
     responsive layouts) and implement the basic design principles of Proximity, Alignment, Repetition and Contrast. In
     addition,
     basic usability concepts can be implemented readily. The review materials listed in the overview page are meant to
     help brush up with these skills as needed.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>A zip file containing a base folder along with subfolders of <a href="/340br/phpmotors/downloads/starter-assets.zip" title="Download the zip file to get started">starter assets should be downloaded</a>, unzipped and placed in your htdocs folder. All subsequent work with the PHP Motors web site will be performed here.</p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <h3>Build a Template</h3>
    <p>You are to build a generic template for the PHP Motors web site (a template is a page that contains no content, it is a resource from which actual content pages, known as views, can be built). See the illustration below:<br>
     <img src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/template.png" alt="An image of the PHP Motors template"></p>

    <p>The template must:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>use the .php file extension,</li>
     <li>use HTML5 semantic structures (header, nav, main and footer) for page sectioning,</li>
     <li>include the viewport meta element,</li>
     <li>include the <b>media="screen"</b> attribute for the css link element,</li>
     <li>use the color scheme shown:<br>
      <img src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/motors-colors.png" alt="PHP Mptors color swatchs">
     </li>
     <li>use fonts of your choice, but they should fit the cartoon look and feel,</li>
     <li>be fully responsive to a variety of devices so that the content loads without horizontal scrolling or zooming
      (see the video illustration below),</li>
     <li>use usability concepts, the minimum expectations are:
      <ul>
       <li>links contain title attributes</li>
       <li>images contain alt attributes</li>
       <li>fonts are easily read and contain clear contrast between background and foreground colors</li>
       <li>headings form a meaningful document outline with no levels being missed</li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>use external CSS for all styling. The CSS must:
      <ul>
       <li>be stored in the provided css folder,</li>
       <li>start with a mobile first approach (this means that CSS for mobile devices is outside of media queries,),</li>
       <li>be responsive to varying screen sizes of a variety of devices,</li>
       <li>use media queries for responsive layout only for larger screen sizes (don't go overboard here, limit the number of media queries to one or two - but remember that CSS inside media queries adjusts styles for larger devices),</li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>use modularization for common content (e.g. page header, navigation and footer) by:
      <ul>
       <li>Creating a folder in which to store the common code snippets.</li>
       <li>Create a separate code snippet for the PHP Motors header, navigation and footer and store each into the folder.</li>
       <li>Follow the directions in the "<b>Modularizing Common Content</b>" activity to implement the snippets into the template.</li>
       <li>Be sure to thoroughly test that the code from the code snippets get delivered to the template file, and later to the actual web pages (views) that you build using the template.</li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>weigh less than 500Kb total weight, and</li>
     <li>be valid HTML5 and CSS3 code.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Build the PHP Motors Home View</h3>
    <p>Having built the template, you will now use it to build the PHP Motors home view. The view must:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>be named "home.php" and be stored at the root of the <b>phpmotors</b> folder,</li>
     <li>contain the content as shown in the images below and images are found in the images folder,
      <figure><img src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/home_page.png" alt="Picture of the PHP Motors home page for large screen"
        style="border: 1px solid #000; width: 75%;">
       <figcaption><i>PHP Motors home - Large Screen</i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure><img style="max-width: 320px;" src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/home_page_small.png"
        alt="Picture of the PHP Motors home page for mobile screen" style="border: 1px solid #000;">
       <figcaption><i>PHP Motors home - Mobile Screen</i></figcaption>
      </figure>
     </li>
     <li>Write your CSS to position the page content to match as closely as possible the provided images of the home.php view in both large screen and mobile screen layouts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Build and test your code in the local development environment.</li>
     <li>Work with your learning team to accomplish the task and post to and read the weekly discussion board to help one another.</li>
     <li>Check your work to ensure that it meets all of the expectations listed.</li>
     <li>When satisfied that the code is operational:
      <ol>
       <li>Create a short video of the template AND home page. Include in the video:
        <ol>
         <li>both the template and home page as they appear in the browser.</li>
         <li>a demonstration of the responsiveness of the home view in a browser.</li>
         <li>a demonstration of the validity of the HTML5 and CSS3 of the home view in the browser.</li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li>post your video to your YouTube channel and copy the link to the video when published.</li>
       <li>zip the phpmotors folder and name it enhancement 1 (save this zip file outside of your web site)</li>
       <li>submit the zip file to the enhancement 1 assignment dropbox and add the video URL to the dropbox comment.
       </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ul>
