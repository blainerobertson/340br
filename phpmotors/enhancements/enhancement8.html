				<h1>Enhancement 8</h1>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>This week's activities saw us make the navigation bar operational. When a classification name is clicked, that classification's vehicles, from the database, are delivered to a view. This enhancement asks you to take the next step - Specific vehicle information delivered to a view.</p>

				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>In this enhancement you will:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Alter the code for each vehicle being delivered to the classification view so that a link exists for that specific vehicle. When the link is clicked, a "vehicle detail" view is delivered where complete details about that vehicle are displayed.</li>
					<li>Style the vehicle information to display clearly and professionally in any size browser window. </li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Video Overview</h2>
				<p>This short video demonstrates what the finished enhancement will look like and the functionality it should possess.</p>

				<h2>Tasks</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Alter the <b>buildVehiclesDisplay()</b> function in the <b>functions.php</b> file to add a link(s) that, when clicked, sends two name-value pairs to the vehicles controller. One name-value pair must trigger a new control structure to get information about a vehicle. The second name-value pair must indicate the specific vehicle (Hint: What is identifier that is <b>unique</b> to each inventory item? Use it as the value in the name - value pair). Suggestion: look at how e-commerce sites such as amazon.com do it (typically both the item name and image are clickable).</li>
					<li>Add a new control structure to the vehicle controller that will handle the process of getting a specific vehicle's information in order to deliver it to a vehicle detail view. If no vehicle can be found, a message must be set to that effect and the message will be sent to the view instead of the vehicle information.</li>
					<li>Build a function in the "vehicles model" to retrieve information about a specific vehicle in inventory and return it to the controller.</li>
					<li>Build a custom function in the <b>functions.php</b> file that will take the specific vehicle's information and wrap it up in HTML to deliver to the view, specifically:
						<ul>
							<li>Use the full-size image, not the thumbnail image.</li>
							<li>The make, model and price should be prominent in the view.</li>
							<li>The price must display as U.S. Dollars with appropriate currency symbol and proper place value commas.</li>
							<li>The description must be present.</li>
							<li>The other vehicle items must be displayed with appropriate supporting text to make sense to a site client. See this image from hertz car sales as an example:<br>
								<img src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/car-example.jpg"
									alt="Example of a car detail view from hertz car sales">
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Build a new view named "<b>vehicle-detail.php</b>" and save it to the <b>view</b> folder using your template file. The view must:
						<ul>
							<li>Display the vehicle make and model in the title element and in the main content heading.</li>
							<li>Have the ability to display a message if one exists.</li>
							<li>Display the vehicle details by echoing the variable containing the vehicle details wrapped up in HTML from your custom function.</li>
							<li>Be valid HTML5 and use valid CSS3 to display the vehicle information for easy reading and presenting a professional appearance. For large screens, the image and content must sit side-by-side (similar to the example car image). On small screens, the content should stack into a single column.</li>
							<li>The content must maintain its clarity of presentation in the browser as the browser window grows or shrinks. In other words, it must be responsive.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Test, Test, Test</h2>
				<p>Be sure to complete all tasks and then test that they work.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Load the phpmotors site in your local development environment.</li>
					<li>Click a link in the main navigation bar.</li>
					<li>From the classification vehicles that should be presented in the browser click the provided link(s) for any vehicle.</li>
					<li>The vehicles's details should be visible in a new view. The details are clear, professional in appearance that can be easily consumed by the human looking at the browser.</li>
					<li>Change the screen size to emulate delivery to various device sizes. The content should be responsive and adjust to allow clear presentation regardless of screen size.</li>
					<li>Repeat multiple times (clicking on navigation link, then "drilling down" to the vehicle detail) to ensure that the process works with all vehicles.</li>
				</ol>


				<h2>Submission</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Work with your learning team to accomplish the tasks and post to and read the weekly discussion board to help one another.</li>
					<li>Build, run and test to make sure that each of the tasks works.</li>
					<li>When satisfied that the code is operational:
						<ol>
							<li>Create a video showing:
								<ul>
									<li>The process in action by clicking on multiple vehicles from multiple classifications to show that each vehicle is delivered to the detail view.</li>
									<li>Use a browser emulation tool to show various size screens
										to show that the vehicle detail maintains a professional appearance and can be easily read, on all screen sizes.</li>
									<li>That the vehicle detail view is valid HTML5 and CSS3.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Post your video to your YouTube channel and copy the link to the video when published.
							</li>
							<li>Zip the entire phpmotors folder and name it enhancement 8 (save this zip file outside of your web site).</li>
							<li>Submit the zip file to the enhancement 8 assignment dropbox and add the video URL to the assignment dropbox comment.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ul>
