			<h1>Enhancement 8</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This week's activities saw us make the navigation bar operational. When a classification name is clicked, that
				classification's vehicles, from the database, are delivered to a view. This enhancement asks you to take the
				next step - Specific vehicle information delivered to a view.</p>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>In this enhancement you will:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Alter the code for each vehicle being delivered to the classification view so that a link exists for that
					specific vehicle. When the link is clicked, a "vehicle detail" view is delivered where complete details about
					that vehicle are displayed.</li>
				<li>Style the vehicle information to display clearly and professionally in any size browser window. </li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Video Overview</h2>
			<p>This short video demonstrates what the finished enhancement may look like and the functionality it could
				possess.</p>

				allowfullscreen></iframe>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Alter the <b>buildVehiclesDisplay()</b> function in the <b>functions.php</b> file to add a link(s) that,
					when clicked, sends two name-value pairs to the vehicles controller. One name-value pair must trigger a new
					control structure to get information about a vehicle. The second name-value pair must indicate the specific
					vehicle (Hint: What is identifier that is <b>unique</b> to each inventory item? Use it as the value in the
					name - value pair). Suggestion: look at how e-commerce sites such as amazon.com do it (typically both the item
					name and image are clickable).</li>
				<li>Add a new control structure to the vehicle controller that will handle the process of getting a specific
					vehicle's information in order to deliver it to a vehicle detail view. If no vehicle can be found, a message
					must be set to that effect and the message will be sent to the view instead of the vehicle information.</li>
				<li>Build a function in the "vehicles model" to retrieve information about a specific vehicle in inventory and
					return it to the controller.</li>
				<li>Build a custom function in the <b>functions.php</b> file that will take the specific vehicle's information
					and wrap it up in HTML to deliver to the view, specifically:
					<ul>
						<li>Use the full-size image, not the thumbnail image.</li>
						<li>The make, model and price should be prominent in the view.</li>
						<li>The price must display as U.S. Dollars with appropriate currency symbol and proper place value commas.
						</li>
						<li>The description must be present.</li>
						<li>The other vehicle items must be displayed with appropriate supporting text to make sense to a site
							client. See this image from hertz car sales as an example:<br>
							<img src="/340br/phpmotors/images/php-motors/car-example.jpg"
								alt="Example of a car detail view from hertz car sales">
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Build a new view named "<b>vehicle-detail.php</b>" and save it to the <b>view</b> folder using your template
					file. The view must:
					<ul>
						<li>Display the vehicle make and model in the title element and in the main content heading.</li>
						<li>Have the ability to display a message if one exists.</li>
						<li>Display the vehicle details by echoing the variable containing the vehicle details wrapped up in HTML
							from your custom function.</li>
						<li>Meet the standards shown in the <a
								href="https://blainerobertson.github.io/340br/phpmotors/views/dev-checklist.html"
								title="Open the web development checklist in a new tab" target="_blank">Frontend
								Checklist</a> and display the vehicle information for easy reading and presenting a
							professional appearance.</li>
						<li>For large screens, the image and content must sit side-by-side (similar to the example car image). On
							small screens, the content should stack into a single column.</li>
						<li>The content (including images) must maintain its clarity of presentation in the browser as the browser
							window grows or shrinks. In other words, it must be responsive.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Test, Test, Test</h2>
			<p>Be sure to complete all tasks and then test that they work.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Load the phpmotors site in your local development environment.</li>
				<li>Click a link in the main navigation bar.</li>
				<li>From the classification vehicles that should be presented in the browser click the provided link(s) for any
					vehicle.</li>
				<li>The vehicles's details should be visible in a new view. The details are clear, professional in appearance
					that can be easily consumed by the human looking at the browser.</li>
				<li>Change the screen size to emulate delivery to various device sizes. The content should be responsive and
					adjust to allow clear presentation regardless of screen size.</li>
				<li>Repeat multiple times (clicking on navigation link, then "drilling down" to the vehicle detail) to ensure
					that the process works with all vehicles.</li>
			</ol>


			<h2>Submission</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Work with your learning team to accomplish the tasks and post to and read the weekly discussion board to
					help one another.</li>
				<li>Build, run and test to make sure that each of the tasks works.</li>
				<li>When satisfied that the code is operational:
					<ol>
						<li>Create a video showing each of the items listed in Objective 6 of the grading matrix.</li>
						<li>Post your video to your YouTube channel as "Unlisted" and copy the link to the video when published.
						</li>
						<li>Zip the entire phpmotors folder and name it enhancement 8 (save this zip file outside of your web site).
						</li>
						<li>Submit the zip file to the enhancement 8 assignment dropbox and add the video URL to the assignment
							dropbox comment.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
			<p>This enhancement has values in multiple objectives as shown below:</p>
			<h3>Objective 1</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The vehicle detail view meets the standards shown in the <a
						href="https://blainerobertson.github.io/340br/phpmotors/views/dev-checklist.html"
						title="Open the web development checklist in a new tab" target="_blank">Frontend
						Checklist</a>.</li>
				<li>The vehicle information is responsive and can be easily read on changing screen sizes without zooming or
					horizontal scrolling. This includes a multi-column layout on large screens and stacked layout on small
					screens.</li>

				<li>Total value for Objective 1: 10 points</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Objective 2</h3>
			<ul>

				<li>A new custom function exists in the <b>functions.php</b> file to take the vehicle details and build HTML
					around it then return the result to the controller and works correctly.</li>
				<li>Total value for Objective 2: 10 points</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Objective 3</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The vehicle detail delivery process works and is an MVC solution.</li>
				<li>Total value for Objective 3: 5 points</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Objective 4</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The vehicle detail function in the "vehicles model" uses a PDO Prepared Statement approach and works.</li>
				<li>Total value for Objective 4: 5 points</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Objective 5</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Name-value pairs passed into the controller from the classification view are filtered and/or sanitized prior
					to being sent to the function for use with the database.</li>
				<li>Total value for Objective 5: 5 points</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Objective 6</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The video URL is present and the video is narrated by you using your own voice. The video shows:

								appearance</mark> and can be easily read, on all screen sizes.</li>
						<li>That the vehicle detail view meets the standards shown in the <a
								href="https://blainerobertson.github.io/340br/phpmotors/views/dev-checklist.html"
