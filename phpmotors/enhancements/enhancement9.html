			<h1>Enhancement 9</h1>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>In this enhancement you are asked to implement enhanced functionality for the site based on image uploads. This
				enhancement will consist of three general tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Run the current vehicle images through the new image upload tool, which will move them to a new location,
					and add their file path to the database.</li>
				<li>Revise some of the work that was done last week in order to get the vehicle details from the inventory
					table, but the path for the large, primary image from the images table.</li>
				<li>Add new functionality so that we can add vehicle thumbnails to the vehicle detail page and style everything
					to look professional.</li>
			</ol>


			<!-- <h3>Revisions</h3>
			<ol start="8">
				<li>Return to the inventory controller, model and helper functions and make alterations so that all image paths
					are now obtained from the <b>images</b> table.</li>
				<li>Alter the SQL query in the <code>getVehiclesByClassification()</code> function of the vehicle-model.php file
					so that only images that are "Primary" images are returned.</li>
				<li>Be sure to test using "print_r()" or "var_dump()" with the returned array to ensure that everything
					continues to work as before.</li>
				<li>Ensure that the DeLorean image to the home page works from its location in the "images>vehicles" folder.
				</li>
			</ol> -->
			<!-- <h3>New Functionality</h3>
			<ol start="11">
				<li>Write code that will find and deliver any vehicle thumbnail images from the database to the vehicles
					"detail" view when a vehicle is selected via the main menu of the PHP Motors site.</li>
				<li>Add CSS so that the thumbnails for a vehicle appear to the left of the vehicle detail information.</li>
				<li>Add CSS so that when a thumbnail is hovered over on the large screen only, the image will enlarge to show
					more detail. When the mouse leaves the image, it will return to normal size.</li>
			</ol> -->

			<h2>Video Overview</h2>
			<p>This short video demonstrates what the finished enhancement will look like and the functionality it should
				possess.</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<h3>Add Vehicle Images</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Change the target of image uploads in the uploads controller to the "<b>phpmotors/images/vehicles</b>"
					folder from the current "uploads/images" folder.</li>
				<li>Delete all records from the images table so that it is empty.</li>
				<li>Make a duplicate of the <b>phpmotors/images/vehicles</b> folder to your desktop. Once done, delete all of
					the
					images inside the <b>phpmotors/images/vehicles</b> folder in the PHP Motors site.</li>
				<li>Upload all existing vehicle images using the upload process so that the images will be sized correctly and
					stored into the "<b>images</b>" table of the phpmotors database and to the "phpmotors/images/vehicles"
					folder.
					<mark>Each of these uploads should be designated as "Primary" images.</mark></li>
				<li>Add the DMC DeLorean to the inventory table.</li>
				<li>Upload the DeLorean image and associate it with the car, making it the primary image.</li>
				<li>If you do not already have an image associated with the "Dog Car", associate the "no-image" picture to it.
					Make the "no-image" image the primary image for that vehicle.</li>
				<li>Add at least one additional image to <b>three</b> vehicles. These images will NOT be primary images, rather,
					they will be additional images for the vehicle.</li>
			</ol>
			<!-- <ol>
				<li>During the activities for this week all image uploads are directed to the "<b>images</b>" folder inside the
					"<b>uploads</b>" folder. This was great for testing, but not so good for the PHP Motors site. Therefore:
					<ol>
						<li>Change the target path to point to the "<b>vehicles</b>" folder within the main "<b>images</b>" folder
							at the root of the PHP Motors site.</li>
						<li>The change will occur in the "<b>uploads</b>" controller.</li>
						<li>Once made, run the file upload tool to make sure your new images are being stored to the correct
							location.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>The current image files in the "images > vehicles" folder are not sized correctly, nor do they appear in the
					"<b>images</b>" table of the database. We want both to occur, therefore:
					<ol>
						<li>Copy the existing "images > vehicles" folder and store it on your desktop.</li>
						<li>Delete all existing images in the original "images > vehicles" folder within the phpmotors folder.</li>
						<li>Use the image upload application to upload the original images and associate them with the correct
							vehicle. Each of these images must be designated as "Primary" images for the vehicel. The thumbnails do
							not need to be uploaded as new thumbnails will be created as part of the upload process.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol> -->
			<h3>Revisions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Alter the code for the home view so that the large, primary DeLorean image is now displayed in the home view
					from its location in the
					"phpmotors/images/vehicles" folder.
				</li>
				<li>When done uploading the images you will need to alter the
					functionality for displaying vehicles by classification. All images should now be obtained from the images
					table
					and not the inventory table. In the model it will require the use of a "JOIN" and a "LIKE" in the query, as
					well as limiting images to primary, thumbnail images. When done, click
					each classification item in the navigation bar and make sure the primary thumbnail image of each vehicle
					appears in the classification view and is
					from the images table.</li>
				<li>You will need to revise the function for obtaining vehicle details to display in the detail view so that the
					vehicle details, without the images, is still obtained from the inventory table, but the primary, large image
					comes from the images table.</li>
				<li>Do NOT alter the function that obtains vehicle information that is used in the vehicle editting process.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>New Functionality</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>When the "vehicle detail" view is loaded, the large, primary image should display (again, from the images
					table). But what if additional images have been uploaded for that vehicle? It would be beneficial if
					"thumbnails" of all images pertaining to that vehicle were displayed. Therefore:
					<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
						<li>In the uploads model, build a new function that will obtain all thumbnail image path information from
							the
							"<b>images</b>" table that are based on the vehicleId. You will need to use the <a
								href="//www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">LIKE</a> operator
							in your SQL query to find "-tn" in the file name.</li>
						<li>In the <b>vehicles</b> controller, call the function when the vehicle detail page is requested. <b>The
								uploads model will have to be brought into the controller's scope.</b></li>
						<li>The returned list of thumbnail images should be fed into a custom function that will wrap them in HTML
							so they are ready to be viewed. No additional information about the image needs to be included, just the
							thumbnail image itself with an "alt" value added to the image.</li>
						<li>The HTML containing the images should be included into the "vehicle detail" view by the "vehicle"
							controller when the view is delivered and styled to be professional in appearance. The thumbnails must
							appear on the left of the vehicle detail view on large screens, and below the vehicle information on
							mobile
							screens. On mobile screens a heading should appear above the thumbnail images.</li>
						<li>Add CSS that will cause a thumbnail to enlarge in size when hovered over. When the mouse leaves the
							thumbnail image, it should return to normal size. This should occur only on large screens, not mobile
							devices.</li>
						<li>Add at least one additional non-primary image (it doesn't matter if they actually match the vehicle) to
							at least
							three inventory vehicles.</li>
						<li>To test, access the "vehicle detail" view via the car classification view. Make sure the additional
							thumbnail images appear and are professional in their appearance. The view should continue to be valid
							HTML5 and valid CSS3 when done.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
